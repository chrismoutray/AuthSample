ASP.Net Authorization NOT persisting example
--------------------------------------------

Basic MVC3 project with forms authentication options selected as part of the setup wizard.

No changes made except within the POST method "public ActionResult LogOn(LogOnModel model, string returnUrl)" within the AccountController class.

Purpose of example is to show that users authetication is not persisted across browser sessions even though the auth tickets isPersistent flag is set to true.
The only way I can get the authorization and therefore implement a "rememeber me" from the login is to add the following after the cookie object is created.

    if (thisIsPersistent)
        cookie.Expires = DateTime.Now.AddYears(1);
